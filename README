## 📱 Secure Authentication Made Easy! 📱

![TOTP Generator]()

This standalone TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) generator creates secure authentication codes for your favorite services that support 2FA. No more fumbling with your phone or dealing with app permissions - just a dedicated device that provides authentication codes whenever you need them!

## ✨ Features ✨

- 🌐 **Easy WiFi Setup**: Configure via captive portal, no hardcoding required
- 🔄 **Custom TOTP URL**: Paste any OTP Auth URL through the configuration portal  
- 📊 **Visual Timer**: Countdown bar shows time remaining before code changes
- 🔄 **Auto-Refreshing Codes**: Generates new codes every 30 seconds
- 🕒 **NTP Time Sync**: Ensures accurate time for proper code generation
- 🔁 **WiFi Recovery**: Automatically reconnects if connection drops
- 🔧 **Physical Reset**: Hold button for 5 seconds to enter configuration mode
- 📱 **Standalone**: Works anywhere with WiFi access

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements 🛠️

- ESP32-S3 Board with 1.9" 170x320 Smart Display
  - Available from [HackerBoxes 0114 WOPR](https://hackerboxes.com/collections/past-hackerboxes/products/hackerbox-0114-wopr)
- USB power source

## 📦 Required Libraries 📦

- TFT_eSPI
- WiFi
- WiFiManager
- TOTP
- SHA1

## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

### 1️⃣ Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code
2. Open the project in PlatformIO
3. Adjust display settings in the include/User_Setup.h file if needed
4. Build and upload to your ESP32 device

### 2️⃣ First-time Setup

1. Power on the device
2. When prompted, press and hold the RESET/BOOT button for 5 seconds
3. Connect your phone or computer to the "TOTP_Setup" WiFi network (password: mbenztotp)
4. Open your browser and navigate to 192.168.4.1
5. Configure your WiFi network
6. Paste your TOTP Auth URL in the provided field
7. Save the configuration

### 3️⃣ Usage

Once configured, the device will:

1. Connect to your WiFi network
2. Sync time with NTP servers
3. Generate and display TOTP codes automatically
4. Show a countdown timer with remaining validity time
5. Display current time and WiFi connection status

## 🔄 Reset Configuration

If you need to reconfigure the device:

1. Press and hold the BOOT button (GPIO0) for 5 seconds
2. Follow the instructions on screen
3. Connect to the WiFi access point and enter new settings

## 🔧 Technical Details 🔧

This project uses:

- **WiFiManager** for easy network configuration
- **NTP** for accurate time synchronization
- **TOTP algorithm** for generating secure codes
- **TFT_eSPI** for display management
- **ESP32's non-volatile memory** to store configuration

## 📝 How TOTP Works 📝

Time-based One-Time Passwords provide a secure way to authenticate without revealing permanent credentials:

1. A shared secret key is established between the user and service
2. The current time (in 30-second intervals) is combined with this secret
3. A cryptographic hash function creates a unique code
4. The code changes every 30 seconds, making it temporary and secure
